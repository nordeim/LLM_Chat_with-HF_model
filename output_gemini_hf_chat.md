**Code Changes Made:**

1.  **Added `trust_remote_code=True` during model and tokenizer loading:**
    ```diff
    -     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) # Added trust_remote_code=True
    -     model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name) # Added trust_remote_code=True
    +     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) # Added trust_remote_code=True
    +     model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True) # Added trust_remote_code=True
    ```
    The `trust_remote_code=True` argument is now passed to both `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` and `AutoModel.from_pretrained` within the `chat_with_model` function. This allows loading models with custom code.

2.  **Added `LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-2.4B` to `available_models` and `model_descriptions`:**
    ```diff
    -     available_models = [default_model, "google/flan-t5-small", "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview"] # Keep SmolDocling but lower priority
    +     available_models = [default_model, "google/flan-t5-small", "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview", "LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-2.4B"] # Added LGAI-EXAONE model
    ```
    ```diff
    -     "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview": "SmolDocling-256M-preview (Experimental - May not support direct generation)"
    +     "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview": "SmolDocling-256M-preview (Experimental - May not support direct generation)",
    +     "LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-2.4B": "EXAONE-Deep-2.4B (Requires trust_remote_code=True)" # Added description for EXAONE model
    ```
    The `LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-2.4B` model is added to the list of available models and a corresponding description is added to `model_descriptions` to indicate that it requires `trust_remote_code=True`.

3.  **Updated Error Message for Model Loading:**
    ```diff
    -     error_message = f"Error loading model: {e}. Please check the model name and your internet connection."
    +     error_message = f"Error loading model: {e}. Please check the model name and your internet connection. If you are trying to use a model that requires `trust_remote_code=True`, ensure it is included in the model list and selected."
    ```
    The error message for model loading is enhanced to hint at the `trust_remote_code=True` requirement if that might be the cause of the error.

4.  **Added Note about `trust_remote_code=True` in UI Markdown:**
    ```diff
    -     gr.Markdown("Choose a model and start chatting. You can also upload an image along with your text. **Note:** Not all models are designed for direct text generation. If you encounter errors, try a different model from the dropdown, especially models like GPT-2 or FLAN-T5.") # Added note about model compatibility
    +     gr.Markdown("Choose a model and start chatting. You can also upload an image along with your text. **Note:** Not all models are designed for direct text generation. If you encounter errors, try a different model from the dropdown, especially models like GPT-2 or FLAN-T5. Some models might require `trust_remote_code=True` to load.") # Added note about trust_remote_code
    ```
    A note is added to the UI using `gr.Markdown` to inform the user that some models might require `trust_remote_code=True` to load.

**Validation Steps:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the updated code as `hf_chat_gemini-v3.py` (or any filename you prefer).
2.  **Run the code:** Execute the script using `python3 hf_chat_gemini-v3.py`.
3.  **Check for errors:** Verify that the application starts without errors.
4.  **Test model loading:** In the Gradio UI, select the `EXAONE-Deep-2.4B (Requires trust_remote_code=True)` model from the dropdown. Ensure that the model loads successfully without the "Error loading model" message related to `trust_remote_code`.
5.  **Test chat functionality with EXAONE-Deep-2.4B:** Try chatting with the `EXAONE-Deep-2.4B` model to see if it generates responses (if it is designed for text generation). If it's not designed for generation, expect the "This model does not support direct text generation..." message.
6.  **Test other models:** Test other models in the dropdown (like GPT-2 and Flan-T5) to ensure they still load and function correctly and that the `trust_remote_code=True` change hasn't negatively impacted them.

By adding `trust_remote_code=True` and updating the UI and error messages, the application should now be able to load and potentially use models like `LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-2.4B` that require this parameter. Remember the security implications of `trust_remote_code=True` and only use it for models from trusted sources.

```

**Key Changes and Explanation:**

1.  **Default Model Changed:**
    ```diff
    -     default_model = "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview"
    +     default_model = "gpt2" # Changed default model to a text generation model
    ```
    The default model is now set to `"gpt2"`, which is a well-known text generation model and is expected to work with `.generate()`. This provides a better out-of-the-box experience for the user.

2.  **Model Descriptions:**
    ```python
    model_descriptions = { # Model descriptions for UI clarity
        "gpt2": "GPT-2 (Text Generation)",
        "google/flan-t5-small": "FLAN-T5 Small (Text Generation)",
        "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview": "SmolDocling-256M-preview (Experimental - May not support direct generation)"
    }
    ```
    A `model_descriptions` dictionary is added to provide more informative labels in the model dropdown.  For `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview`, a note "(Experimental - May not support direct generation)" is included to warn the user about potential issues.

3.  **Dropdown with Descriptions:**
    ```diff
    -     model_selector = gr.Dropdown(available_models, value=default_model, label="Choose Model")
    +     model_selector = gr.Dropdown(
    +         choices=[(model_descriptions[name], name) for name in available_models], # Display descriptions in dropdown
    +         value=default_model,
    +         label="Choose Model"
    +     )
    ```
    The `gr.Dropdown` now uses `choices` to display the model descriptions to the user, making the selection more user-friendly.

4.  **Model Compatibility Note in UI:**
    ```diff
    -     gr.Markdown("Choose a model and start chatting. You can also upload an image along with your text.")
    +     gr.Markdown("Choose a model and start chatting. You can also upload an image along with your text. **Note:** Not all models are designed for direct text generation. If you encounter errors, try a different model from the dropdown, especially models like GPT-2 or FLAN-T5.") # Added note about model compatibility
    ```
    A `gr.Markdown` element is added to the UI to explicitly inform the user that some models might not be suitable for direct text generation and to suggest trying different models if they face errors.

5.  **`hasattr(model, 'generate')` check:**
    ```diff
    +     if hasattr(model, 'generate'): # Check if model has generate method before calling it
            with torch.no_grad(): # Disable gradient calculation for inference
                outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=500, num_return_sequences=1) # Adjust max_length as needed
            response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

            # Basic cleanup for better readability - can be model specific and improved
            response = response.replace(user_message, "").strip() # Remove input echo if model does that
            if not response:
                response = "Sorry, I couldn't generate a meaningful response." # Handle empty response
        else:
            response = "This model does not support direct text generation using `.generate()` method. Please try a different model from the dropdown."
    ```
    The code now checks if the loaded `model` object has a `generate` method using `hasattr(model, 'generate')` before attempting to call it. If the `generate` method is not found, it provides a user-friendly message explaining that the model is not suitable for direct text generation and suggests trying another model.  This prevents the code from crashing and gives the user helpful guidance.

6.  **Improved Error Message in `chat_with_model`:**
    ```diff
    - except Exception as e:
    -     response = f"Error generating response: {e}"
    + except Exception as e:
    +     response = f"Error generating response: {e}. This model might not be suitable for text generation in this application setup. Please try a different model."
    ```
    The error message in the `except` block is also improved to be more informative and guide the user to try a different model if generation fails.

These changes make the application more robust, user-friendly, and informative, especially when dealing with models that may not be designed for direct text generation using the `.generate()` method. The user is now guided to choose appropriate models and understand potential limitations.

**Code change explanation:**

*   **`AutoModelForCausalLM` replaced with `AutoModel`:**
    ```diff
    -         model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    +         model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name) # Changed AutoModelForCausalLM to AutoModel
    ```
    We have changed the model loading class from `AutoModelForCausalLM` to `AutoModel`.  `AutoModel` is a more general class that can automatically infer the model type from the pretrained model's configuration and load the appropriate model architecture. This is often the recommended approach when you are not sure about the exact model class.

**Validation Steps:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the updated code as `hf_chat_gemini-v2.py` (or any filename you prefer).
2.  **Run the code:** Execute the script using `python3 hf_chat_gemini-v2.py`.
3.  **Check for errors:** Verify that the application starts without the "Unrecognized configuration class" error.
4.  **Test the chat functionality:** Open the Gradio UI in your browser and try chatting with the `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` model and other models in the dropdown to ensure they load and respond as expected. Test both text-only inputs and image uploads (keeping in mind the image upload is currently for placeholder demonstration and context passing).

By making this change to `AutoModel`, the code should now be able to load the `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` model (assuming it's compatible with the `transformers` library) and the Gradio application should function correctly. If the model still fails to load with `AutoModel`, further investigation into the specific model type and potential `transformers` version compatibility might be needed, but this change addresses the most likely cause based on the error message.

    ```

This change replaces the specific image file path `'images/gradio_logo.png'` with `None` in the example prompts. This will prevent Gradio from trying to load the image file when initializing the examples, thus resolving the `FileNotFoundError`.  The example description "Describe this image." is kept to indicate the intended functionality, even though no specific image is loaded in this example prompt.

After applying this change, please re-run the python script `hf_chat_gemini-v2.py` to verify that the error is resolved and the Gradio application launches correctly. The example prompts will now work without requiring the `images/gradio_logo.png` file to be present. The image upload functionality of the application remains available for users to manually upload images during chat.

```python
<think>The user wants a Python Gradio web application that facilitates chatting with image file uploads, leveraging the Hugging Face model `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview`. The application needs to be user-friendly, modern, intuitive, and attractive, resembling the ChatGPT UI.  Users should be able to select different Hugging Face models, with `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` set as the default.

Here's a plan to create this application:

1.  **Import necessary libraries:** `gradio`, `transformers`, and potentially `PIL` for image handling if needed.
2.  **Define a function to load the Hugging Face model and tokenizer.** This function will take the model name as input and load the corresponding model and tokenizer from Hugging Face Hub.
3.  **Create a chat function** that takes user input text, optionally an uploaded image, and the selected model name. This function will:
    *   Load the specified model and tokenizer.
    *   Process the input text and image (if provided) to be compatible with the model's expected input format.  *(Need to investigate if `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` is designed for image and text, or just text. If just text, focus on text chat first and consider image integration later or using a different model if image support is crucial)*. For now, assume text-based chat as the primary functionality and handle image upload for potential future expansion or as context to the conversation if the model can use it.
    *   Generate a response from the model.
    *   Return the model's response as text.
4.  **Design the Gradio UI using `gr.Blocks` for more flexibility and control over layout.**
    *   **Model Selection:** A `gr.Dropdown` to allow users to choose from a list of Hugging Face models, including `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` as the default.
    *   **Chatbot Display:** A `gr.Chatbot` component to display the chat history in a visually appealing manner, similar to ChatGPT.
    *   **User Input Textbox:** A `gr.Textbox` for users to type their messages.
    *   **Image Upload Component:** A `gr.File` or `gr.Image` component for users to upload image files.
    *   **Submit Button:** A button to send the user's message and image to the chatbot.
    *   **Clear Button:** A button to clear the chat history.
5.  **Implement the UI layout and connect the components to the chat function.**
6.  **Style the Gradio UI to be modern and attractive.** Use themes and custom CSS if necessary to enhance the visual appeal.
7.  **Test the application thoroughly** to ensure it works as expected, including model loading, text and image input, response generation, and UI functionality. Handle potential errors gracefully, such as model loading failures.
8.  **Consider best practices for LLM chat apps:**
    *   Clear chat history functionality.
    *   Responsive and intuitive interface.
    *   Visual feedback during model processing (e.g., "typing..." indicator, though not strictly necessary for a basic example).
    *   Appropriate handling of long conversations and context (though state management within Gradio can be handled by the `history` variable in `gr.Chatbot`).

Let's start by building a text-based chat first, incorporating model selection and a clean UI, and then think about how to effectively integrate image upload if the default model `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` or a suitable alternative can handle image inputs in a meaningful way within a chat context.  If `SmolDocling-256M-preview` primarily handles text, we will focus on making a robust and attractive text chat application with model choice.

For initial implementation, we will focus on text input and model selection, and then research how to best incorporate image handling, potentially in a follow-up enhancement.

**To Run this application:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the code above as a Python file (e.g., `image_chat_app.py`).
2.  **Install libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install gradio transformers torch Pillow
    ```
3.  **Prepare example image (optional):** If you want to use the example image, create a folder named `images` in the same directory as your script and place an image file named `gradio_logo.png` (or adjust the example path accordingly). You can use any image for testing. If you don't have an image ready, you can remove the image example from `gr.Examples` for now.
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python image_chat_app.py
    ```
5.  **Access in browser:** Open your web browser and go to the URL displayed in the console (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860/` or `http://localhost:7860/`).

**Key improvements and explanations:**

*   **`gr.Blocks` for UI:**  Using `gr.Blocks` provides more control over the layout and customization of the UI, which is preferred for more complex applications and achieving a modern look.
*   **Model Selection Dropdown:**  `gr.Dropdown` allows users to choose from a list of Hugging Face models, with `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` as the default.
*   **Image Upload (gr.File):**  `gr.File` is used for image upload.  Note that the current code just passes the file information as a placeholder text `<image: filename>` into the chat for demonstration and potential future image processing.  **`ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` as a text-based language model is unlikely to directly process image content from just the filename.**  For actual image understanding, you would need a model specifically designed for vision-language tasks and implement image processing steps.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included for model loading and response generation.
*   **Clear Button:** `gr.ClearButton` efficiently clears the message textbox, chatbot history, and image input.
*   **Example Prompts:** `gr.Examples` provides users with example prompts to quickly test the application. An example with an image placeholder is included to demonstrate the image upload functionality in the UI, even though the current backend is text-focused.
*   **Modern Theme:**  `theme=gr.themes.Soft()` sets a visually appealing modern theme.
*   **Chatbot Customization:** `bubble_radius`, `show_copy_button` are used to customize the `gr.Chatbot` appearance.
*   **Clear Instructions and Notes:**  Markdown elements are used to provide clear instructions, descriptions, and notes to the user, especially regarding the current limitations of image processing and the text-focused nature of the provided backend.
*   **CPU/GPU handling:** Basic example of moving model and inputs to CPU for broader compatibility. You can adjust this for GPU usage if you have a CUDA-enabled GPU and want faster inference, by changing `"cpu"` to `"cuda"` and ensuring CUDA is properly set up.

This improved version provides a more robust, user-friendly, and visually appealing Gradio chat application with model selection and image upload UI, while clearly outlining the current text-based focus and potential for future image processing enhancements. Remember to explore models that are specifically designed for image and text understanding if you want to achieve true image-based chat functionality.

---
The user wants a Python Gradio web application for chatting with image file uploads, using the `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` Hugging Face model as the default. The application should have a user-friendly, modern, intuitive, and attractive UI, similar to ChatGPT. The user should be able to specify a Hugging Face model as input, with the default being `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview`.

Here's a breakdown of the steps to create this application:

1. **Research and identify necessary libraries:**
    - Gradio for the web UI.
    - Transformers for interacting with Hugging Face models.
    - Potentially `PIL` (Pillow) for image handling.

2. **Set up the Hugging Face model:**
    - Load the `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` model using the Transformers library.
    - Understand the input requirements of this model (likely text and image).
    - Determine how to pass image files to the model.

3. **Design the Gradio UI:**
    - Chat interface similar to ChatGPT (using `gr.ChatInterface` or custom components).
    - File upload component (`gr.File` or `gr.Image`) for image input.
    - Model selection input (`gr.Dropdown` or `gr.Textbox`) to allow users to specify the Hugging Face model.
    - Textbox for user input.
    - Display area for chatbot responses.
    - Clear button to clear chat history.

4. **Implement the chat logic:**
    - Function to handle user input (text and image).
    - Function to load the specified Hugging Face model (or use the default).
    - Function to process the input and generate a response from the model.
    - Function to update the chat history in the Gradio UI.

5. **Code structure and best practices:**
    - Use clear function names and comments.
    - Handle potential errors (e.g., model loading errors, input validation).
    - Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly.
    - Implement a way to switch models dynamically.

6. **Testing and refinement:**
    - Test the application with different inputs (text only, image only, text and image).
    - Test model switching functionality.
    - Refine the UI based on user experience considerations.
    - Check for any dependencies and ensure they are included in `requirements.txt`.

**Detailed steps and code design:**

* **Libraries:**
    - `gradio`: For UI. `pip install gradio`
    - `transformers`: For Hugging Face model. `pip install transformers`
    - `torch`: Required by transformers. `pip install torch`
    - `Pillow`: For image handling. `pip install Pillow`

* **Model Loading:**
    - Use `transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained` and `transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` (or similar, depending on the model type of SmolDocling-256M-preview).
    - Need to check the model documentation to see if it's a CausalLM or another type. It's likely a text and image model, so might need a different class. Let's assume it's a CausalLM for now and adjust if necessary.
    - Need to pre-process the image and text input before feeding to the model.

* **UI Components:**
    - `gr.ChatInterface` seems appropriate for a chat-like UI. However, it might not directly support image uploads in the standard way. We might need to build a custom interface using `gr.Blocks`.
    - Let's start with `gr.Blocks` for more control over the layout.

* **Function to handle chat:**
    - Input: `message` (text), `image` (uploaded file), `model_name` (string).
    - Load model based on `model_name`.
    - Preprocess `message` and `image` for the model.
    - Generate response from the model.
    - Return the response.

* **Model Input format for SmolDocling-256M-preview:**
    - Need to research the input format for this specific model on Hugging Face Hub.
    -  From the model card, it seems like a general-purpose language model. Need to explore if it's specifically designed for image and text input or just text.  Let's assume for now it handles text input and we need to figure out how to incorporate image later if possible. If it's not designed for images directly, we can focus on text chat first and then explore image integration if the model allows it.

* **Let's start with a text-only chat interface using the specified model first and then enhance it to handle images if the model supports it.**  If SmolDocling-256M-preview doesn't natively handle images, we can re-evaluate and potentially suggest a different model that does or implement a simpler image-to-text then text-to-LLM approach as a future enhancement.

**Revised Plan (Text Chat First):**

1. **Text-based chat using `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview`:**
    - Gradio UI with `gr.ChatInterface` or `gr.Blocks` (let's start with `gr.ChatInterface` for simplicity).
    - Model selection using `gr.Dropdown`.
    - Chat function to load model, process text input, and generate text response.

2. **Image upload and integration (if possible, future enhancement):**
    - Add `gr.Image` component for image upload.
    - Investigate if `ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview` can handle images. If not, explore models that can.
    - Modify chat function to process image input if the model supports it.

Let's proceed with step 1, building a text-based chat interface with model selection.

**Code Structure (Initial Draft):**

```python
import gradio as gr
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

def predict(message, history, model_name):
    # Load model and tokenizer based on model_name
    try:
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error loading model: {e}"

    # Preprocess input
    inputs = tokenizer(message, return_tensors="pt")

    # Generate response
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

    return response

if __name__ == '__main__':
    default_model = "ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview"
    model_names = [default_model, "gpt2", "google/flan-t5-small"] # Example models, user can add more
    model_dropdown = gr.Dropdown(model_names, value=default_model, label="Choose Model")

    iface = gr.ChatInterface(
        predict,
        chatbot=gr.Chatbot(height=300),
        textbox=gr.Textbox(placeholder="Enter your message here...", container=False, scale=7),
        title="Image Chat with Hugging Face Model",
        description="Chat with a Hugging Face model. Upload an image and ask questions!", # Modified description
        theme="soft", # Modern theme
        additional_inputs=[model_dropdown]
    )
    iface.launch()
```

**Double check:**
- Imports are correct.
- `predict` function loads model and tokenizer.
- Input processing and response generation logic.
- Gradio UI setup with `ChatInterface`, `Dropdown`, theme.
- Default model and model options.
- Launching the interface.

**Refinement and Testing:**

- Test if the model loads correctly.
- Test basic text chat.
- Add error handling for model loading.
- Improve UI aesthetics if needed.
- Check if `SmolDocling-256M-preview` works for basic text chat.

Let's test this initial version and then enhance it based on the model capabilities and user feedback.
