Let us analyze the error and the code carefully:

1. Error Analysis:
- The error occurs when trying to load the EXAONE model using AutoModel
- The specific error indicates that the ExaoneConfig class is not recognized for AutoModel
- This suggests we need to use a different AutoModel class specific to this model type

2. Code Review:
- Current implementation uses AutoModel.from_pretrained()
- The model loading is in the chat_with_model function
- The EXAONE model is listed in available_models
- The error mentions the model requires trust_remote_code=True (which is already set)

3. Investigation:
- Looking up LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-2.4B documentation
- This model appears to be a causal language model
- We should use AutoModelForCausalLM instead of AutoModel for this type of model

4. Solution Options:
a) Change AutoModel to AutoModelForCausalLM for all models
   Pros: Works for causal language models
   Cons: Might not work for all models in the list

b) Add model-specific logic to choose the correct AutoModel class
   Pros: Most flexible and robust solution
   Cons: More complex code

c) Remove EXAONE model from available_models
   Pros: Simple fix
   Cons: Reduces functionality

5. Decision:
- Option b) is the most robust solution
- We'll modify the code to use different AutoModel classes based on model name
- This maintains flexibility while fixing the error

6. Validation:
- The change only affects model loading
- Other functionality remains unchanged
- Error handling is already in place

Here's the updated code with the fix:

```python
def chat_with_model(message, history, model_name, image_file):
    """
    Chat function that interacts with a Hugging Face language model.

    Args:
        message (str): User input text message.
        history (list): Chat history.
        model_name (str): Name of the Hugging Face model to use.
        image_file (TemporaryFile): Uploaded image file (can be None).

    Returns:
        tuple: Updated chat history and the model's response.
    """
    history = history or []

    if not message and not image_file:
        history.append((None, "Please provide text input, image input or both."))
        return history, history

    try:
        # Choose the appropriate model class based on the model name
        if "EXAONE" in model_name:
            model_class = AutoModelForCausalLM
        else:
            model_class = AutoModel

        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
        model = model_class.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = f"Error loading model: {e}. Please check the model name and your internet connection. If you are trying to use a model that requires `trust_remote_code=True`, ensure it is included in the model list and selected."
        history.append((message, error_message))
        return history, history

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    user_message = message
    if image_file:
        image_message = f"<image: {image_file.name}>"
        user_message = f"{user_message} {image_message}" if message else image_message

    history.append((user_message, None))

    inputs = tokenizer(user_message, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
    model = model.to("cpu")
    inputs = inputs.to("cpu")

    try:
        if hasattr(model, 'generate'):
            with torch.no_grad():
                outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=500, num_return_sequences=1)
            response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

            response = response.replace(user_message, "").strip()
            if not response:
                response = "Sorry, I couldn't generate a meaningful response."
        else:
            response = "This model does not support direct text generation using `.generate()` method. Please try a different model from the dropdown."

    except Exception as e:
        response = f"Error generating response: {e}. This model might not be suitable for text generation in this application setup. Please try a different model."

    history[-1] = (user_message, response)
    return history, history
```

Now use the following method for final validation:
1. The fix addresses the specific error by using AutoModelForCausalLM for EXAONE model
2. Maintains backward compatibility with other models using AutoModel
3. Preserves all existing functionality and error handling
4. The change is minimal and focused on the specific issue
5. Existing error messages and handling remain in place
6. The solution is extensible - more model-specific handling can be added if needed

The key change is the addition of model-specific logic to choose between AutoModel and AutoModelForCausalLM based on the model name. This should resolve the error while maintaining compatibility with all other models in the list. The rest of the code remains unchanged to preserve existing functionality.
